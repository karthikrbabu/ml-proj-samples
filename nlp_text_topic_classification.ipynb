    "- GridSearchCV determines that K=19 is the optimal value, though this is on the high end! One major drawback of KNN is that it doesn't perform well when the dimension of your data is very high (i.e. you have a lot of features). In our case here each feature vector has 26,879 features. The dimensionality of the feature space grows, but it becomes very sparse. Due to this sparsity, it becomes much easier to find a separable hyperplane because the likelihood that a training sample lies on the wrong side of the best hyperplane becomes infinitely small. However, when this highly dimensional classification is projected back to a lower dimensional space, there would be a high level of overfitting of the model to the training data. The model would learn the training data too well and not perform well on new data.\n",

    "- A last point here is that KNN works off distance in the feature vectors, our representation of text is a binary array of 1's and 0's as flags for the existance of words. For example the meaning associated with two sentences talking about the same topic, though the two sentences have no common words, could be considered two very different vectors on the vector space with a potentially large distance between. Hence they would not be \"neighbors\". A simple example, \"Your house is so beautiful\" vs. \"The place you live is aesthetic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above reasons, we can see that KNN is not the best solution for our classification.\n",

    "In our case here the amount of samples we train on and test on is not that large (~2000 samples). Naive bayes is built off the assumption that each feature is conditionally independent, while logistic regression is trying to calculate correlations amongst the features which then go into the odds function that ultimately determines the class. Because our feature vectors are so large, and that we are trying to represent text data, in translation it is difficult to capture all the correlations between words in lengthy somewhat sparse vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally logistic regression would perform better than naive bayes with a larger dataset size, though this does not take away from the fundamental independence assumptions that naive bayes operates on training with knowledge of the prior. \n",

That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "These are both are methods to convert text data into vectors of numerical values as representations for the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "With CountVectorizer we count the number of times a word appears in a document which can result in a bias towards the most frequent words, as their slot on the vector would be larger than the average word.(i.e, a document that is all the same word would strongly bias the data). As a result of the bias, CountVectorizer can overlook more rare words which could actually be very relevant for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "With TfidfVectorizer we look at an overall document weightage of a word. The inverse document frequency calculation adjusts for the scenarios where some words appear more frequently in general. For example, even though words like “we”, and “the” appear often in documents, since it appears often in a bunch of documents, they don't provide much useful information about what makes a document unique. Overall this helps us penalize super frequent words, and rather weights the word counts based on how often they appear throughout the documents."

    "Ultimately some solutions to improve the model, could begin with applying preprocessing before running our TfidVectorizer and tokenizing our words. In theory we could play with all the various pre processing steps that I have included in Problem #5, this should help! In addition we can adjust the vocab size with minimum and/or maximum thresholds for word frequency using \"min_df\" and \"max_df\" as an option within TfidfVectorizer.\n",

    "Interestingly enough in the cases that the correct label was **talk.religion.misc** but was predicted as **comp.graphics** both have what we can call \"proper nouns\" such as the words \"Mormon\", \"ftp\", \"online\", and \"internet\". For the \"atheism\" documents, we see similar patterns that the prediction was wrong because the documents had words/phrases such as \"Jesus Christ\", \"The_Transcedental_Temptation\", \"government\". These are unique words that might not be getting weighted appropriately. A possible solution is doing some analysis to figure out what these top unique words are, and increasing the weightage on these type of words relative to the correct class category. This would happen during the preprocessing and training stage and using our computed set list of proper nouns by category. Padding those words in to the document to increase the frequency of that words appearance. This way the model learns the weights with a slight bias, but nudged in the right direction."
